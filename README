# Armored Elytra Fixer Upper

A datafixer mod to convert data stored by the [VanillaTweaks Armored Elytra Data Pack](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) from the old NBT format(1.20.4 and below) to the new components format(1.20.5+)

**NOTE** There's no official version of Armored Elytra for 1.20.5 yet. This currently converts to an unofficial port's format which will not be compatible with the official version. This mod will be updated to the match the official version once it is released.
